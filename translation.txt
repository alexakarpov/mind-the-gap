Ending the Moscow church schism of 1467-1560: story's fina;e in documents

Introduction

The basis for the schism of the church of Moscow lies in the events of 1441-1467, when it ended its subordinate relationship with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and broke the canonical communion with the rest of the Orthodox world. This was a beginning of a long period of isolation of the Muscovite kingdon, a state of things which would persist until 1560-1561, when the metropolis of  Moscow would separate from that of Kiev, and return under the omophorion of the Patriarch of Constatntinople; a point of ending its unlawful autocephaly. Canonical autocephaly will be granted Moscow only in 1590, together with the status of patriarchate, through a council held in Constantinople.

Below we will focus on the events of 1557-1561 and their immediate prehistory. Diplomatic documents and patriarchal chaters will serve as our primary sources - the chosen kind of sources of Igor Pavlovich Medvedev. Dedicating this article to his anniversary is for us a joy and a great honor.


2. Moscow schism before the inthronization of Ioann IV

Metropolitan Jonas, installed to the see of Moscow in 1446, retained both his title of the Metropolitan of Kiev, and his formal subordination to the patriarch of Constantinople.

After Jonas reposed in 1461, Theodosius (Byval'tsev) became a new metropolitan, as per the will left by Jonas, presumably retaining "Kiev" in his title. The following confirmation of his title by the patriarch in Constantinope was implied, but never actuality happened. In 1464 Theodosius voluntarily left the cathedra, under the pretext of illness. Next metropolitan, Philippe, was appointed without any attempts to legitimacy. Metropolis of Kiev is still one, but as for the metropolitans appointed in Moscow over the remaining part of XV century, starting with Philippe, there's no data on their formal titles. Among the documents which preserved to our times the only title mentioned is the unofficial "metropolitan of all Russia", without a name of the particular city; using an official title would point out an inconsistency.

De facto, communion with the patriarchs in Constantinople never resumed after the repose of metropolitan Jonas. Not surprising, then, is the fact that after the repentance of Gregory the Bulgarian, Uniate metropolitan of Kiev, he alone was reinstated as the lawful metropolitan of the see of Kiev in 1466. This was followed by a diplomatic exchange between Constantinople, Vilno and Moscow, on the subject of Moscow's acceptance of the canonical appointment of metropolitan Gregory. The results of that exchange followed shortly. In the beginning of 1467, hierarchy of Moscow was already deposed by patriarch Dionisios as one in the schism. Shortly after (the exact date is not known) Moscow replied by prohibiting the ecclesiastical communion with Constantinople and western parts of the metropolis of Kiev.

In the very beginning of 1470-s, a new ideology of autocephaly of Moscow started to take shape; it was duly reinforced in 1472 (the translation of the relics) by the cult of metropolitan Jonas as the founder of this autocephaly - a development that Jonas himself, while yet alive, hardly envisioned. Pachomios Logothet, in a panegyric for the said translation, attaches his veneration to the existing cultt of the Three Hierarchs of Moscow - Peter, Kyprian and Photios. In the future, Kyprian and Photios will be replaced by Alexii and Jonas.

De jure, metropolis of Kiev remained united, but now there were two mutually exclusive versions of who is the metropolitan thereof, and where does the power of appointing one reside. De facto, the feeling of autonomy of from Kiev metropolis solidified in Moscow, which manifested in the local title of 'metropolitan of Moscow'. This title became quite established by the time of metropolitan Varlaam (1511-1521), even though we still don't have the evidence of its usage as a formal title during his intronization.

A patriarchal charter to Varlaam from Theoliptus of Constantinople, dated with July 1516, is still using the old title, "metropolitan of Kiev". The authenticity of the Slavonic translation of this letter, however, is questionable, and the original is lost. The charter is linked to the Greek church embassy that delivered it, and this story was heavily redacted in official Russian chronicles. Judging by the "Reconds of Judicial Interrogations of Maximos the Greek and Isaac Sobaka", embassy received a very cold reception, with an emphasis made on the absence of communion with Greeks, while in the official chronicles this is reversed.

The embassy of patriarch Theoliptus was the most serious of the steps attempted since 1467 to bring peaceful resolution to the schism. The result was a fiasco, and led to a life imprisonment for its leader, Maximos the Greek (since his arrest in Moscow in 1525 to his death in 1555/1556 in home confinement in Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra, conditions of his confinement changed, but he never regained his freedom). During that time, the Non-posessors party, that since the end of XV century worked within the Russian church to end its uncanonical status, suffered a complete defeat.

One little researched episode, related to the very beginning of the rule of future king John the Terrible, is the period of the reign of metropolitan Ioasaf (1539-1542, â€  1555/1556), installed largely as a result of some boyar intrigues, and deposed in the same manner. In his oath of enthronement (the copy is preserved), he swore his allegiance to the patriarch of Constantinople. Ioasaf did a lot to improve the conditions of Maximos the Greek, and in general admired his writings, having done a lot to spread them; he ended his days near Maximos, in Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra (they reposed in the same year). At the same time, Ioasaf was a staunch enemy of the Josephite party, and have tried, as much as he could, to preserve the church from the influence of Joseph Volotsky. However, there's no evidence of any negotiations with Constantinople. Till the end of his life he was well respected by church and civil authorities, but hardly had any real influence on the church politics. It wouldn't be too much of a stretch to consider his reign an attempt to heal the Moscow's schism - a first such attempt during the reign of Ioann IV.


3. Second attempt to end the Moscow schism during the reign of Ioann IV

Maximos the Greek and the remnants of the Non-posessors party were still alive in 1546-1547, when the question of the Moscow schism was brought up once more - this time, in connection to the transformationist plans of the days of the beginning of the reign of Ioann IV.
It isn't surprising, then, that the name of Maximos the Greek comes up from the very beginning of the process. And to mark this beginning, let's take the address to tsar Ioann IV, compiled at the local council of Constantinople, assembled in June of 1546 for the purpose of the inthronization of new patriarch Dionisios II. This address was signed by the 50 hierarchs of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, includin the patriarch himself, joined by the patriarch Herman of Jerusalem. The formal occasion was to inform Ioann IV of the inthronization of a new patriarch, but it also contained one request - to allow Maximos the Greek to return home. Same request was also contained in an earlier letter from the patriarch Ioachim of Alexandria, dated April 4, 1545, but this new missive had a notable difference: John IV was no longer addressed as "Great Prince", but as "Tsar and Great Prince"; and, as was noted by Dan Muresan, this is half an year before the official crowning of Ioann IV.
Dan Muresan interpreted the councilar encyclical of 1546 as a proposal to start a serious conversation about the unlawful aitocephaly of Moscow - the interest of Maximos the Greek to the same subject was the primary reason for his loss of freedom. Translated from the diplomatic language, the offer made by patriarch Dionisios was as follows: we will recognize you as a tsar of Rus, if you bring the church of Moscow back under obedience to the Constantinople patriarchate; as a sign of your good will, you can let Maximos the Greek go home.
This is where the diplomatic negotiations had begun; though not Maximos the Greek nor Dionisios would live to see their finale, at which Constantinople would be victorious. Ioann IV would give up the autocephaly of Moscow, without receiveing the recognition as a reincarnatiopn of "Basileos Romeon".
The offer, presented by patriarch Dionisios, was understood in Moscow, and was received with certain enthusiasm. By January 1547 Ioann IV was enthroned. Same year Maximos the Greek was transferred from Otroch Monastery in Tver to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius; his condition was now better, but in place of freedom he was, as we would call it today, under house arrest. Evidently, negotiations were mean to continue, which necessitateted keeping of Maximos as a hostage. The focus for the negotiations, too, was obvious.
In 1547 an addirion to the protocol of crowning was the inclusion of the lineage of Ioann, traced to August Caesar, with an implied claim to the inheritance of the Byzantine Empire. Therefore, the doctrine of Moscow as a "Third Rome", introduced several years earlier, was made official. Therefore, the demand to the Constantinople patriarchate was more than recognition of Ioann as a Tsar of "all Russia", some remote region of the inhabited world, but the very same King, who is the subject of the "Symphony". Renouncing the claim to autocephaly of Moscow wouldn't be too big of a price to pay, if the other side of the deal would offer the Constantinople patriarchate itself.
But the patriarchate didn't rush with accepting the ambitions of the Tsar in Moscow, and took a time-out. It would seems that there were no new developments between 1547 and Stoglavy Synod of 1551 in the dialog between Moscow and Constatntinople.
